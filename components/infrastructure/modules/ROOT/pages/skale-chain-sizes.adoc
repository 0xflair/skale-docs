= SKALE Chain Sizes

SKALE Chain sizing is tuned during development and testnets and is set both by the schain_allocation.yml file in SKALE Node, and by SKALE Manager which tracks resource allocation of nodes in the network.

[NOTE]
Medium size chains are only supported. Other sizes will be available in later releases.

[NOTE]
Current node storage for each SKALE Chain is allocated to consensus (30%), blockstorage (30%), filestorage (30%), and logs (10%).
