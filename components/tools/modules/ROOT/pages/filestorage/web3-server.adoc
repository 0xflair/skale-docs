= File Storage Web3 Server

SKALE Chain nodes run a special NGINX Webserver that provides read-only access to each file uploaded using SKALE Chain Filestorage.

To access the file, use the following URL conventions depending on the endpoint you are using:

If using the reverse proxy load balancer:

`http(s)://REVERSE_PROXY_ENDPOINT/fs/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH`

If connecting directly to a single node:
`http(s)://NODE_DOMAIN_NAME/SKALE_CHAIN_NAME/FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH`

[NOTE]
The uploader address in the URLs **MUST omit the 0x prefix AND be in lowercase**. For example: `0x77333Da3492C4BBB9CCF3EA5BB63D6202F86CDA8` must be entered as `77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8`

Example:

```shell
https://network.skalenodes.com/fs/chubby-sadr/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/directoryA/random_text.txt # reverse-proxy
https://node1.validator.com/fluffy-marsupial/77333da3492c4BBB9ccf3Ea5bb63d6202f86cda8/directoryA/random_text.txt # node

```

The NGINX config is as follows:
