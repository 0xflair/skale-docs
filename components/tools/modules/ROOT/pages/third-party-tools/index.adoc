= Third Party Tools

SKALE is EVM -- Ethereum Virtual Machine -- compatible meaning that many of the existing tools in the Web3 space are compatible out of the box with SKALE. Listed below are a few of the platforms and tools that can help developers build quickly and efficiently when building on SKALE.

== Cookbook
