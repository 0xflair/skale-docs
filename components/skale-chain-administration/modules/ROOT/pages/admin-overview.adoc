= Administration Overview

SKALE Chain owners have special privileges for managing their SKALE Chain, Filestorage, and IMA Bridge settings. The following is a summary of those settings:

* SKALE Chains

* Filestorage

== Managing Ownership using a Multisig Contract

With newer SKALE Chains, you can assign administrative and other roles to a Multisig contract and define a threshold number of signatures required to confirm and execute transactions.

There are several ways to do this: 

* xref:gnosis-safe-setup.adoc[Use Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum]. <- RECOMMENDED
* xref:multisig-setup.adoc[Use the predeployed Gnosis MultiSigWallet on SKALE].
* Use other custom contracts or multisigs.
* Use a mixture of the above approaches (Use Gnosis SAFE for IMA Mainnet contracts, and SKALE chain predeployed Multisig for IMA contracts on SKALE.)

Using Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum is the recommend approach to assigning SKALE Chain ownership since it provides the greatest flexibility to owners.

[IMPORTANT]
Once SKALE Chain ownership is assigned to an address, that address cannot be changed for SKALE Chain specific SKALE Manager and IMA Mainnet administration methods. Assigning ownership to a Gnosis SAFE address offers that SAFE's owners the ability to modify signers/owners at any time.

|===
|Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum |Gnosis Multisig on SKALE

|Administration performed through Ethereum transactions
|Limited administration performed through SKALE Chain transactions

|Can administer:

* SKALE Manager (e.g. deleteSchain, schainOwnerWallet)
* SKALE Chain configs
* Etherbase
* Filestorage
* IMA SKALE chain contracts
* IMA mainnet contracts

|Can administer:

* SKALE Chain configs
* Etherbase
* Filestorage
* IMA SKALE chain contracts

|Each transaction requires Mainnet Ethereum gas
|Each transaction is zero-cost gas on SKALE

|Uses the latest Gnosis SAFE contracts and UI
|Uses older and depreciated MultiSigWallet contracts and UI

|Uses IMA Bridge to transfer SAFE messages to SKALE
|Doesn't require the IMA Bridge

|Fallback option to use the predeployed MultiSigWallet on SKALE
|No fallback option
