= Multisig General Instructions

[WARNING]
Instructions provided here are for **general purposes only** on how to transition a SKALE Chain from a single owner account to a multisig. You are highly encouraged to apply your own security evaluation, process, and review to suit a multisig setup for your specific needs. 

To use Gnosis **MultiSigWallet** for SKALE Chain owner administration, follow the instructions below, which are based on the tools and steps provided here: <https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet>.

[NOTE]
These instructions are for Gnosis' **MultiSigWallet**, which has been depreciated for Gnosis **SAFE**. At this time, Gnosis SAFE is yet not supported, and is planned for future releases.

== SKALE Chain Setup

[IMPORTANT]
Before proceeding, be sure your SKALE Chain is deployed and assigned ownership to a single account and is funded with skETH. The SKALE Chain will have several predeployed contracts including Marionette and a predeployed Gnosis MultiSigWallet. These instructions detail how to interact with the predeployed multisig.

. Add your SKALE Chain endpoint to Metamask.
. Setup a Gnosis MultiSigWallet local server or use a ready-made instance on IPFS using this link: <https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet#an-instance-of-multisig-website-is-available-on-ipfs-at-httpsipfsinfuraioipfsqmfrd4guqzobni2nt2c77a3utq452ffwstr4fjejixugjf>
. Select your SKALE Chain endpoint in Metamask.
. Click `Unlock Metamask` in the MultiSig UI.
. Click `Add` button.
. Click `Restore deployed wallet` to add the already deployed multisig.
. Add the name and address of the multisig and click `ok`.

From here, 

* You can now edit the required confirmations:

* Add additional owners by clicking the multisig name,

And then add additional owners:

== Sending Multisig Transaction

. Click the name of your deployed multisig to view the multisig details.
. Click the `Add` button in the "Multisig transactions" box. A modal will appear with further inputs.

+
. Enter the contract address, name (optional), and paste in the contract ABI. For example, if you want to permit another address to deploy contracts, paste in the DeploymentControl ABI (https://github.com/skalenetwork/predeployed/blob/master/deploy-control/DeploymentController.abi) and contract address `0xD2002000000000000000000000000000000000D2`.
. After a moment, the `Method` field should populate with the available methods.
. Select the method to execute, and add any additional information. For example, select `addToWhitelist` and enter the address to allow deployment permissions.
. Click `Send multisig transaction`.
. The multisig will then request the various owners to sign off on the transaction.
. Send the deployed multisig address to each owner so they each can load the multisig.

== Signing off

Each multisig signer should follow the instructions for signing off:

. Add the SKALE Chain to Metamask.
. Setup a local server or use a ready-made instance on IPFS using this link: <https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet#an-instance-of-multisig-website-is-available-on-ipfs-at-httpsipfsinfuraioipfsqmfrd4guqzobni2nt2c77a3utq452ffwstr4fjejixugjf>
. Select the SKALE Chain endpoint in Metamask to which the multisig will be deployed.
. Click `Unlock Metamask` in the MultiSig UI.
. Click `Add` button to add a Multisig.
. Click `Restore deployed wallet` to add an already deployed multisig.
. Add the name and address of the multisig and click `ok`.
. Click the multisig name and you should see the pending transaction.  
. Click `confirm` to sign the transaction.
. Wait until the other required signers signoff, and then the transaction will finally execute.
