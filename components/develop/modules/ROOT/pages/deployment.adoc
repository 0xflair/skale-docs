Need a development SKALE Chain to deploy to? xref:ima-sdk.adoc[Checkout the IMA SDK instructions].

Deploying to SKALE is similar to deploying to the Ethereum blockchain. There are a few changes you will need to make within your deployment scripts. When using these code samples, please be sure to modify the code appropriately before running anything in production!

You can share your own code sample by reaching out to the SKALE developer community on discord.

Use these deployment script examples to deploy your smart contracts onto your SKALE Chain.
