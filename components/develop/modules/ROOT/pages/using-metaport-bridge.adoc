= Using Metaport Bridge

== What is the Metaport Bridge

The Metaport Bridge is a tool that simplifies the process for end-users to transfer tokens between Ethereum and any SKALE Chain or Dapp, as well as facilitating token transfers between different SKALE Chains.

Developers can use the Bridge as an alternative to implementing their own Metaport widget.

== How is it different from the Metaport Widget?

The Metaport widget is an embeddable React component that can be used by SKALE Community developers to guide users through a SKALE IMA bridge transaction, without having to leave the dapp.

The Metaport Bridge implements the Metaport widget - just as other dapps building on SKALE can also implement the Metaport widget into their user flows. The Bridge is more like a general tool, allowing users to navigate any Bridge transfer within the SKALE Network. The Metaport Bridge provides zero-cost, near-instant transfers of assets and data between connected SKALE chains, as well as fast-finality transfers between SKALE Chains connected to Ethereum mainnet (ETH gas fees apply to Ethereum mainnet transactions).

== Sending users with fallback

You can direct users to the Metaport bridge with suggested transfer steps by using the following URL structure: 

Basic context:
`https://bridge.skale.network/#/bridge/transfer/{source-chain-name}/{destination-chain-name}?{optional-url-parameters}`

=== Optional parameters:

* `to-app`: name of destination dapp
* `from-app`: name of source dapp
* `token`: token symbol for transaction
* `amount`: amount of token to prefill
* `fallback-url`: url to be redirected once transaction is complete and user clicks button with fallback-text
* `fallback-text`: text to present to the user for returning to fallback url

[NOTE]
Note that fallback-url and fallback-text should be encoded with encodeURIComponent().

== Examples

For transferring from Calypso to Europa:
`https://bridge.skale.network/#/bridge/transfer/honorable-steel-rasalhague/elated-tan-skat` 


For transferring from Ethereum to NFT Trade on Calypso:
`https://bridge.skale.network/#/bridge/transfer/mainnet/honorable-steel-rasalhague?to-app=nftrade&`


.Example of fallback-url and fallback-text

`&token=skl&amount=250&fallback-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnftrade.com%2Fassets%2Fskale%2F0x3b6f8d50938900ef14fbac48575c33a849ffd683%2F1&fallback-text=Return%20to%20NFT%20"Solitude"`
