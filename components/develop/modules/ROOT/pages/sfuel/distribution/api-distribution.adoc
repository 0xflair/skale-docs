= API Distribution

The API distribution method references a more application owned distribution as opposed to an on-chain distribution.
This utilizes servers to faciliate sFUEL distribution to users through by exposing an API endpoint through the server or by having fill-up funcitonality
called directly within existing services i.e when new accounts are created and stored in a database.

[WARNING]
Code samples and recipes provided are examples of this method, however, may not be suitable for production use.
