= Administration Overview

SKALE Chain owners have special privileges for managing their SKALE Chain, Filestorage, and IMA Bridge settings. The following is a summary of those settings:

== Managing Ownership using a Multisig Contract

With newer SKALE Chains, you can assign administrative and other roles to a Multisig contract where a predefined number of signatures are required to confirm and execute transactions.

There are several ways to do this: 

* xref:gnosis-safe-setup.adoc[Use a Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum]. 
* xref:multisig-setup.adoc[Use the predeployed Gnosis MultiSigWallet on SKALE].
* Use other custom contracts.
* Use a mixture of the above approaches (Use Gnosis SAFE for IMA Mainnet contracts, and SKALE chain predeployed Multisig for IMA contracts on SKALE.)

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===
|Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum |Gnosis Multisig on SKALE

|Administration performed through Ethereum transactions
|Limited administration performed through SKALE Chain transactions

|Can administer:

* SKALE chain
* Filestorage
* IMA SKALE chain contracts
* IMA mainnet contracts
|Can administer:

* SKALE Chain
* Filestorage
* IMA SKALE chain contracts

|Each transaction requires Mainnet Ethereum gas
|Each transaction is zero-cost gas on SKALE

|Uses the latest Gnosis SAFE contracts and UI
|Uses older and depreciated MultiSigWallet contracts and UI

|Uses IMA Bridge to transfer SAFE messages to SKALE
|Doesn't require the IMA Bridge

|Fallback option to use the predeployed MultiSigWallet on SKALE
|No fallback option
