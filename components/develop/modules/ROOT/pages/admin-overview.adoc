= SKALE Chain Administration Overview

SKALE Chain owners have special privileges for managing their SKALE Chain, Filestorage, and IMA Bridge settings. The following is a summary of those settings:

== Managing Ownership using a Multisig Contract

With newer SKALE Chains, you can assign administrative and other roles to Multisig control. There are several ways to do this: 

* Use Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum. 
* Use Gnosis MultiSigWallet on SKALE.
* Use other custom contracts.

You are free to explore both approaches or even use a mixture of these approaches.

|===
|Gnosis SAFE on Ethereum |Gnosis Multisig on SKALE

|Administration performed through Ethereum transactions
|Limited administration performed through SKALE Chain transactions

|Can administer:

* SKALE Chain
* FileStorage
* IMA SKALE Chain contracts
* IMA Mainnet contracts
|Can administer:

* SKALE Chain
* FileStorage
* IMA SKALE Chain contracts

|Each transaction requires Mainnet Ethereum gas
|Each transaction is zero-cost gas on SKALE

|Uses the latest SAFE contracts and UI
|Uses older and depreciated MultiSigWallet contracts and UI

|Uses IMA Bridge to transfer SAFE messages to SKALE
|Doesn't require the IMA Bridge

|Fallback option to use the predeployed MultiSigWallet on SKALE
|No fallback option
