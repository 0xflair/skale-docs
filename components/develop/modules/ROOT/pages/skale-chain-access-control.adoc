= SKALE Chain Access Control

SKALE Chains have several ways to manage access control, meaning who is capable of sending a transaction to the SKALE Chain or who is capable of deploying new contracts. Two methods manage access: distribution of skETH to SKALE Chain users and the DeploymentController contract, which authorizes specific contracts to deploy new contracts (CREATE2).

== Deployment Controller

New SKALE Chains are set only to allow the SKALE Chain owner and CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes the ability to deploy new contracts. Other addresses can be permitted on the fly to deploy contracts by whitelisting addresses.

The predeployed DeploymentController contract's address is `0xD2002000000000000000000000000000000000D2` and contains two methods: `addToWhitelist(address)` and `removeFromWhitelist(address)`.

The ABI for the DeploymentController is available here: https://github.com/skalenetwork/predeployed/blob/master/deploy-control/DeploymentController.abi[DeploymentController.abi].

== SKALE ETH (skETH)

The SKALE Chain owner (coinbase address) is allocated skETH when the SKALE Chain is created. This value is set in the genesis block of each SKALE Chain and therefore cannot be changed once set.

[NOTE]
skETH, unlike ETH, has no value, but like ETH is used to meter transaction usage on SKALE Chains.

SKALE Chain owners can apply a variety of methods to distribute skETH to users:
* direct transaction from the owner to an address
* sending an allocation of skETH to a SKALE Chain contract, which applies some logic to distribute skETH to address.

When addresses use skETH to perform transactions, the skETH fee used to conduct the transaction is recirculated back to the coinbase address.

[IMPORTANT]
SKALE Chain owners should carefully select how and how much skETH to distribute to addresses. How much might depend on various factors such as the number of addresses to distribute to, and the skETH transaction fees  performed by these addresses.

[NOTE]
To view Real ETH on SKALE Chains as transferred by the IMA bridge, you can use the _informational RPC ports_ for your endpoint.
