= Filestorage upgrades

The SKALE Chain owner can upgrade pre-deployed Filestorage contracts. The Filestorage contracts uses OpenZeppelin's Upgrade framework.

== Pre-deployed Addresses

Proxy Admin: `0xD3001000000000000000000000000000000000D3`

Proxy Contract: `0xD3003000000000000000000000000000000000D3`

Filestorage Implementation: `0xD3002000000000000000000000000000000000d3`

== Upgrade procedure

. Deploy new Filestorage version on your SKALE Chain.
. Send upgrade transaction to the pre-deployed Proxy Admin, containing the new address of Filestorage Implementation.
. Admin calls the pre-deployed Filestorage Proxy contract and passes the new Filestorage address.
. Proxy now points to the new Filestorage contract.
