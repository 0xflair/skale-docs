== Upgrade procedure

. Deploy new Filestroage version on your SKALE Chain.
. Send upgrade transaction to the pre-deployed Proxy Admin, containing the new address of Filestorage Implementation.
. Admin calls the pre-deployed Filestorage Proxy contract and passes the new Filestorage address.
. Proxy now points to the new Filestorage contract.
