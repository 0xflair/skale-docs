= Overview

Here are a few notes about getting started with SKALE chains.

== SKALE Network Basics

Read up on what is the SKALE Network, what development tools can you use, how to get access to SKALE Chains, and where to reach out for help xref:basics.adoc[in our Basics doc].

== SKALE Chain Sizes

SKALE Chains can be configured into different sizes - sizes being the amount of resource allocation that each of the 16 nodes provides. xref:infrastructure::skale-chain-sizes.adoc[Read more here].

== SKALE Chain FUEL (sFUEL)

SKALE Chains operate with sFUEL, which unlike ETH has no monetary value, but like ETH is used to conduct transactions. xref:skale-chain-fuel.adoc[Learn more about managing sFUEL on your SKALE Chain].

== Providers

You can use various connection abstractions to interface with SKALE Chains, like Web3.js and Ethers.js. xref:recipes::libraries/providers.adoc[Read more about this here].

== Using Remix

You can use Remix as an IDE for deploying to SKALE Chains. xref:tools::third-party-tools/using-remix.adoc[Read more about using Remix here].

== Deployment

You can use a variety of tooling to deploy to SKALE Chains, such as Hardhat, Truffle, Node.js, and Remix. xref:develop::deployment.adoc[Read more about deployment scripts here].
