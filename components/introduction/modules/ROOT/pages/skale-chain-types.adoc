= SKALE Chain Types 
:experimental:

A SKALE chain is categorized as either a App-chain or a Hub-chain.

While Hub and App chains share the same technology under the hood, their application within the SKALE Network differs.

Hubs are community-operated SKALE chains that function as web3 service layers that are divided by their specific use-cases (i.e., a hub for DeFi, a hub for gaming, a hub for NFTs, etc).

App chains are dedicated SKALE chains which provide high-performance throughput to individual applications, such as https://www.cryptoblades.io[Cryptoblades] or https://exorde.network[Exorde].
