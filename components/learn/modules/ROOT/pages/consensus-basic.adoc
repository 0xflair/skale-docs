= SKALE Consensus

SKALE Chains use a mathematically provable BFT consensus algorithm. 

Details of how this consensus algorithm works are xref:technology::consensus-spec.adoc[available here]. We'll give a watered-down version here.

== How it works

SKALE Consensus works in two stages.

=== Stage 1

Each of the sixteen nodes either start with 0 or 1 and broadcast their values to the other nodes. If node X receives `0` from at least 1/3 + 1 of the nodes, then according to the Byzantine assumption, at least one good node has 0.  So you would then broadcast 0 to all others.


=== Stage 2

Stage 2 is a "pre-commit" stage. A node at this stage must wait until 2/3 + 1 nodes
