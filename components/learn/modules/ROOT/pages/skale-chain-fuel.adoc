= SKALE Chain FUEL (sFUEL)
:experimental:

SKALE Chains enable dApps and their users to run scalable, cost-free transactions. This provides an effective way to scale your dApp not only for speed but also to scale economically. SKALE Chains do require users to have sFUEL to conduct transactions â€“ this sFUEL is a gas token with no economic value and provides a way for dApps and users to facilitate permissive access to SKALE Chains and protects against DDoS attacks.

== How to get sFUEL

Each chain in the SKALEverse has their own process and endpoints for distributing sFUEL to users. Often sFUEL is distributed to users through each dapp's onboarding process.

Alternatively, you can head over to the sFUEL station to automatically sFUEL up across all supported SKALE chains: https://sfuel.skale.network/. Enter your account address and click btn:[Fuel Wallet].

== Developing with sFUEL

There are a few ways developers can manage and allocate SKALE FUEL (sFUEL), depending on your setup.

== sFUEL on SKALE SDKs

For SKALE SDKs, an account is pre-allocated with SKALE FUEL (sFUEL). You can use this for conducting transactions, sending to users on your SKALE Chain, and more. See the README in the respective SDK for the pre-allocated account, or check your `.env` file setup.

== sFUEL on Mainnet and Testnet SKALE Chains

For Mainnet and Testnet, the SKALE Chain owner account is provided sFUEL for the SKALE Chain. From this account, the owner can fund contracts, end-user accounts, conduct transactions, etc. When end-users complete transactions and spend gas, the coinbase account is refunded with sFUEL. The coinbase account for SKALE Chains is the SKALE Owner account.
