= Basics of SKALE Network

== SKALE Network & What it does

The SKALE is an Ethereum native multichain network of high-performance blockchains. The network is open-source and is built to scale Ethereum dApps. The Network enables dApp developers to access validator-operated nodes' compute power and storage to run fast, containerized, EVM-compatible SKALE Chains. Validators run and maintain SKALE Nodes, providing distributed computing power and storage to the SKALE Network. 

The entire SKALE Network is managed by SKALE Manager which is a set of over 35 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. These contracts control network functions such as chain creation, validator registration, node selection, node rotation, staking, bounty payment, slashing, and more.  Network users such as validators, delegators, and dApp Developers exchange SKALE (SKL) tokens to provide stake and access network services.

The https://skale.network/blog/validator-list-for-skale/[SKALE validator community represents over 45 independent operators] running over 150 nodes, and the SKALE Mainnet has been live for over 300 days without interruption. https://countdown.skale.network/[Checkout the current stats.]

With SKALE, dApps run zero-cost transactions on a Proof-of-Stake chain distributed across a randomly chosen set of 16 nodes, each running a containerized EVM. SKALE chains can exchange transactions or messages with other SKALE Chains and Ethereum-based networks, allowing dApp developers to use SKALE for powering their dApps while enabling token and message transfers to and from Ethereum or other chains.

SKALE Network uses a https://skale.network/blog/technical-highlights/[unique combination of technologies and cryptographic-based approaches] to achieve scalability, security, interoperability, and progressive decentralization:
